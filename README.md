Running the program
-
This project consist of an interactive program using user input to maintain and analyze stocks from csv file.

To start the program, open the homeInput.py file and hit run. Start by adding some stocks with the commands specified between '' to call the different commands. In this program you can:

Each command has its own step of subcommands that allow you to do a specific thing within the command you entered.

This program will be helpful to people who are starting to trade in the stock market, like myself, and see some analytics that are done to further understand a stock. Personally, I use the graphs to see the different momentums of a stock and have a small inside on what action to take.

Also, I use the intrinsic value calculation to see an estimate of what the value of a specfic stock should be.
